## Track 4: AI Business Intelligence Agent : Smart Dashboards for Decision-Making

## Problem

SMEs in Asia rely on fragmented, hard-to-use tools to make decisions. Business owners and managers often struggle to get timely answers from platforms like Google Analytics or internal systems. Dashboards exist but donâ€™t speak the userâ€™s language literally or contextually.

## Goal

Build a multilingual BI(Business Intelligence) agent that:

- Connects to Google Analytics (mock or real)
- Accepts queries in chatbot format
- Uses predefined + evolving question sets to answer business queries
- Surfaces actionable insights from connected agents (ads, accounting, etc.)
- Returns responses in English, Mandarin, or Cantonese

## MVP Scope

### Inputs

- Google Analytics (mock data or API output in JSON) <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7586738?hl=en>
- Optional: outputs from other agents (ads optimizer, accounting summaries)

### Agent Capabilities

- Accept user questions via a simple chat interface
- Match user questions to a predefined library (e.g., "What was my bounce rate last month?")
- Expand/improvise these queries using LLM-based NLP
- Return data-driven insights with supporting charts or text summaries

### Outputs

- Chat-like interface for business queries
- Data visualization + natural language summaries
- Multilingual response support

## Agentic Nature

Your BI agent should:

- Select the best dataset + question template based on intent
- Offer follow-up questions for deeper insight
- Learn which types of questions are being asked and evolve its suggestions
- Speak to non-technical users ("Your top page dropped 30% this week")

## Deliverables

- Public GitHub repo
- Chatbot UI demo (recorded or live)
- Screenshot of at least 5 predefined query+response flows
- 1 auto-generated multilingual summary report
- 1-pager PDF on prompt mapping + architecture

ðŸ“¢ Donâ€™t just build a dashboard â€” build a multilingual data advisor that thinks,
recommends, and explains.
